# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# I'm commenting this because I want this to go to Heroku
# will comment out later
# Ignore the default SQLite database.
#/db/*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# The below items came from: http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#code-default_gitignore
# The app was developed on a Windows system and I don't see these in my directory
# but adding them anyway they may be needed if I make changes on Ubuntu.
# I don't know why Michael Hartl would want to add "doc/" (looks like sub-dirs of doc)
# to the list?? 
# Ignore other unneeded files.  
doc/
